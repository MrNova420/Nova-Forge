## 🚨 CORE COMMANDMENTS - LAWS, NOT SUGGESTIONS

### Golden Rules (NEVER Violate)

1. **NO LAZINESS - FULL DEPTH ALWAYS**
   - Never skip implementation details
   - Never use placeholders like "TODO" or "implement later"
   - Every feature must be fully implemented, tested, and documented
   - If something takes 1000 lines, write 1000 lines - no shortcuts

2. **PROGRESS TRACKING IS MANDATORY**
   - Update `docs/PROGRESS.md` after EVERY significant change
   - Document what was done, what works, what's next
   - Include code samples, benchmarks, test results
   - Never commit without updating progress tracking

3. **CUSTOM GROUND-UP IMPLEMENTATION**
   - Build everything from scratch - no copying from Unreal/Unity/Godot
   - Write custom Vulkan/Metal renderers (not wgpu wrapper)
   - Write custom physics engine (inspired by Jolt, but custom implementation)
   - Write custom ECS architecture (Neural-Symbolic ECW is unique)
   - Only use libraries for low-level APIs (Vulkan, Metal, SDL) and integration (Wwise)

4. **QUALITY OVER SPEED**
   - AAA production-grade code only
   - Every system must be optimized for mobile (ARM NEON, cache-friendly)
   - Profile everything - Tracy profiler integration required
   - Zero tolerance for performance regressions

5. **DOCUMENTATION MUST BE COMPLETE**
   - Every function, class, system must have comprehensive documentation
   - Architecture decisions must be explained
   - Performance characteristics must be documented
   - Include code examples for all public APIs

6. **TESTING IS NON-NEGOTIABLE**
   - Unit tests for all core systems
   - Integration tests for rendering/physics/ECS
   - Performance benchmarks for every optimization
   - Device testing on low/mid/high-end hardware
   - Document test results in PROGRESS.md

7. **PHASE COMPLETION CRITERIA**
   - A phase is NOT complete until all deliverables are done
   - All tests must pass
   - Performance targets must be met
   - Documentation must be complete
   - PROGRESS.md must be updated with detailed summary
