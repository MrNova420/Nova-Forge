# Hello Cube - Your First Nova Engine Project

This example demonstrates the basics of Nova Engine by rendering a simple rotating cube with lighting.

## What You'll Learn

- WebGL 2 context initialization
- Shader creation and compilation
- 3D geometry creation (cube)
- Camera setup with perspective projection
- Basic lighting implementation
- Mouse input for camera control

## Running

```bash
# Serve this directory
npx serve
# or
python -m http.server
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` (or appropriate port)

## Controls

- **Mouse Drag**: Rotate camera
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out

## Next Steps

1. Change cube color in fragment shader
2. Add multiple cubes
3. Experiment with lighting
4. Try adding textures
