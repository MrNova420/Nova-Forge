## 💰 Revenue and Royalties

### Q: Is Nova Engine free to use?

**A:** Yes! Nova Engine is completely free to use commercially until your Nova Engine-based projects generate $250,000 USD in a single calendar year.

### Q: When do I have to pay royalties?

**A:** Only when your total gross revenue from ALL Nova Engine-based projects exceeds $250,000 USD in a calendar year. You pay 2% only on the amount above $250,000.

**A:** 2% on revenue above $250,000 per year.

**Example:**
- If you make $100,000: $0 in royalties (under threshold)
- If you make $250,000: $0 in royalties (at threshold)
- If you make $300,000: 2% × $50,000 = $1,000 in royalties
- If you make $500,000: 2% × $250,000 = $5,000 in royalties

### Q: Does the $250,000 threshold reset each year?

**A:** Yes! The threshold resets every January 1st. Previous years' revenue does not carry over.

**Deductions allowed:**

### Q: Do I pay royalties on free games?

**A:** No. If your game generates no revenue, there are no royalties. The $250,000 threshold and 2% royalty only apply to monetized projects.

### Q: What if I have multiple games?

**A:** The $250,000 threshold applies to your **combined total revenue** from ALL Nova Engine-based projects in a calendar year.
