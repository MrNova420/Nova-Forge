Scenario: Your games made $300,000 in 2025

Calculation:
- Total Revenue: $300,000
- Threshold: $250,000
- Taxable Amount: $300,000 - $250,000 = $50,000
- Royalty: $50,000 × 2% = $1,000

You owe: $1,000 in royalties for 2025
Due: By March 1, 2026 (within 60 days of Dec 31, 2025)

Next year (2026): Threshold resets to $250,000 again
